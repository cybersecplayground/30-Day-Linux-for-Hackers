# Day 18 – Linux Kernel & Exploit Basics

## 🔹 Introduction
The Linux kernel is the **core component** of the operating system, responsible for managing memory, processes, devices, and system calls. Since it runs in **ring 0** (the highest privilege level), exploiting kernel vulnerabilities can allow attackers to gain full control of the system.

---

## 🔹 Checking Kernel Version
Attackers and pentesters start by fingerprinting the kernel version to identify potential vulnerabilities.

```bash
uname -r        # Kernel version
uname -a        # Full system info
cat /proc/version
```

Example output:
```
5.4.0-77-generic
```

---

## 🔹 Why Kernel Version Matters
Each kernel version may contain **known privilege escalation vulnerabilities**. Once identified, attackers can look them up in exploit databases such as:

- [Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/)
- GitHub repositories with public PoCs
- CVE databases

### Examples:
- **Dirty COW (CVE-2016-5195):** Allows writing to read-only memory.
- **OverlayFS (CVE-2015-1328):** Privilege escalation in Ubuntu-based kernels.

---

## 🔹 Automating Kernel Exploit Enumeration
Several tools can enumerate kernel vulnerabilities and privilege escalation paths automatically:

```bash
# Linux Exploit Suggester
./linux-exploit-suggester.sh

# Linux Smart Enumeration
./lse.sh
```

These scripts compare system/kernel info with known vulnerabilities.

---

## 🔹 Compiling & Running Exploits
Most public exploits are written in **C**. Example workflow:

```bash
gcc exploit.c -o exploit
./exploit
```

⚠️ **Warning:** Exploits should only be run in **lab environments** (VMs, containers) for testing and learning. Running exploits on production systems is dangerous and illegal without authorization.

---

## 🔹 Pentester Notes
- Kernel exploits are **noisy** and may crash systems.
- Always attempt safer privilege escalation methods (misconfigured sudo, file permissions, PATH hijacking) before trying kernel exploits.
- If kernel exploits are the only option, ensure proper OPSEC and persistence planning.

---

## 📌 Summary
- Kernel runs at the highest privilege level.  
- Fingerprinting kernel version is the first step.  
- Exploits exist for specific versions (Dirty COW, OverlayFS, etc.).  
- Use tools like `lse.sh` or `linux-exploit-suggester.sh` to automate checks.  
- Compile and test exploits in safe environments.
