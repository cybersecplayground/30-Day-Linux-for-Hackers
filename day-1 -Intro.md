Welcome to the **30-Day Linux for Hackers** course.

## 🔍 Why Linux?

Linux is the primary OS used in cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and penetration testing. Mastering it is non-negotiable if you aim to:
- Use tools like `nmap`, `hydra`, `metasploit`, `burp suite`, etc.
- Automate with Bash and Python
- Navigate CTFs and red team scenarios efficiently
- Work with servers and exploit environments

## ✅ Task of the Day

1. Install Kali Linux (on VM or system)
2. Open the terminal and run:
    ```bash
    whoami
    uname -a
    pwd
    ```
3. Research what each command does.

## 🧠 Explanation

- `whoami`: Displays your current logged-in user
- `uname -a`: Shows kernel version, system name, hardware info
- `pwd`: Prints your current directory
